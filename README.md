CT7121 Machine Learning and Data Analytics

The CT7121 Machine Learning and Data Analytics course provides a comprehensive introduction to the core principles, techniques, and applications of machine learning and data analytics. It equips students with the knowledge and skills needed to analyze data, build predictive models, and implement machine learning algorithms effectively. The course covers a range of topics, including supervised and unsupervised learning, data preprocessing, model evaluation, and optimization techniques. Students will gain hands-on experience with tools and programming languages such as Python, TensorFlow, or Scikit-learn, which are essential for modern data science practices.

An important aspect of this course is its emphasis on practical applications. Through real-world examples and datasets, students learn how machine learning can be applied across various industries, from healthcare and finance to gaming and entertainment. The course also introduces data visualization techniques to help interpret complex patterns and insights, enabling students to present their findings clearly and effectively.

In the final project, students have the opportunity to apply what they have learned to a real-world problem. For instance, this project could involve integrating machine learning algorithms into a game development process. By using machine learning, game developers can create dynamic, adaptive experiences for players, such as intelligent NPC behavior, procedurally generated levels, or personalized game difficulty based on player data. Students might use clustering algorithms to analyze player behaviors or reinforcement learning to design smarter AI opponents. This project not only demonstrates the practical use of machine learning in gaming but also allows students to develop innovative solutions that could potentially be implemented in the gaming industry.

Overall, the course provides a strong foundation for leveraging machine learning and data analytics in solving complex problems and innovating in various domains, including game development.
